Last Survivor
=============
### This project is a PHP implementation of last survivor task.

## Task description:
You are in a room with a circle of 100 chairs. The chairs are numbered sequentially from 1 to 100.
At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked to leave.
This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave will keep going around the circle until there is one person leftâ€¦ the survivor.
Identify  which chair the survivor is sitting on.

## Solution:
Two methods are solving the same task using algorithms with recursion and without recustion
Performance method is invoking both of them and outputs execution time.
When invoking these methods with at least 10000 elements, performance difference is significant, but with 100 you won't notice the difference.
